# Design Overview

## Summary

This supplies an overview of the general architecture of `nib`. If you're going
to be hacking around the codebase, it may be helpful to consult this first so
you have a better idea of how the program is designed, as well as how different
modules interact with each other.

In this document I will describe the design of `nib`, as well as explain my
design decisions in a (hopefully) convincing manner.
